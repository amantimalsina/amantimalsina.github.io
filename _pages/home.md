I am a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.purdue.edu/) at Purdue University. I'm advised by [Prof. Tamal Dey](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/tamaldey.html). My research interests span Computational Topology and Computational (Linear) Algebra with applications in Topological Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University at Buffalo, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Atri Rudra](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/atri/) and [Prof. Matthew G. Knepley](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~knepley/).

Here's my brief [CV](https://github.com/amantimalsina/amantimalsina.github.io/edit/master/files/cv.pdf).
