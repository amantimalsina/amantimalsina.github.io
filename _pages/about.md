I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https:cs.purdue.edu/), working under the supervision of my advisor [Prof. Tamal Dey](https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/). My research interests broadly lie in Computational Topology and Computational (Linear) Algebra. Specifically, I'm interested in Topological Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University at Buffalo, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Atri Rudra](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/atri/) and [Prof. Matthew G. Knepley](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~knepley/).
